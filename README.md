This project applies Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to construct and optimize sector-wise investment portfolios in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using historical stock data from 2019 to 2022, it evaluates the performance of key sectors like E-Commerce, Banking, Oil, Aviation, and Automobiles under extreme market conditions.
An Exponential Moving Average (EMA) crossover strategy (9-day vs 21-day) was used to dynamically select stocks indicating bullish trends. Optimal portfolio weights were then determined by maximizing the Sharpe Ratio using the Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) optimization method from SciPy.
The model allows adjustment of the risk-aversion parameter, balancing return and volatility as per investor preference. Finally, the project computes Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) and visualizes portfolio distribution and efficiency.
